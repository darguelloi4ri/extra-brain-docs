# EXTRA-BRAIN at a glance

**Goal.** Develop brain-like neural networks (BLNNs) and a trustworthy, human-centric AI stack that learns fast from minimal data, runs efficiently across the edge–cloud continuum (ECC), and remains explainable and robust in real-world settings.

**Why now.** Classical DNNs are compute- and data-hungry, hard to deploy on constrained hardware, and difficult to interpret in shifting environments. EXTRA-BRAIN addresses these limits with biologically plausible learning (e.g., Hebbian/Bayesian mechanisms), sparse representations, and hardware-friendly designs.

### Specific Needs (SN)
- **SN#1–2:** Flexible, less resource-consuming models; new learning processes reducing data needs (few/one-shot, semi/unsupervised, active learning).  
- **SN#3:** Software–hardware co-design and new profiles suitable for the ECC.  
- **SN#4:** Explainability, trustworthiness, and robust behaviour under uncertainty.  
- **SN#5:** Data optimisation pipeline (feature selection, augmentation/synthetic data, automatic labelling).  
- **SN#6:** Real-world deployment with privacy and ethics built-in.

### Targeted breakthroughs
Energy-/resource-efficient AI, fast learning with less data, explainable and trustworthy pipelines, ethical/human-centric design, and ECC-ready hardware/software implementations.

### Where this fits
Subsequent pages detail the architecture, DOS pipeline, deployment layer, and the three pilots validating the approach in **Robotics (SAR)**, **Digital Finance**, and **Telecommunications (EUA)**.
