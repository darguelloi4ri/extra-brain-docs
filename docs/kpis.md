- **Technical:** real-time perception/decision latency; energy; comms latency; robustness; modularity & scalability; XAI clarity.  
- **Non-technical:** usability/training time; operator trust; mission-management UX; privacy/security compliance; cost-efficiency; stakeholder satisfaction.

## UC2 — Digital Finance (examples)
- **Outcomes:** +30% detection accuracy; +40% performance; ~80% data reduction; +50% fraud-cost reduction; +50% trust uplift.  
- **Technical & Non-technical:** real-time integration; data-utilisation efficiency; XAI clarity; FL effectiveness; personalisation accuracy; trust/transparency; ethics; TCO.

## UC3 — Telecommunications (examples)
