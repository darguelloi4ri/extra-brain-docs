# UC2 â€” Data & Power-Efficient AI for Digital Finance

**Objective.** Increase automation and intelligence in finance with few labelled samples by combining BLNNs with federated neuromorphic learning and XAI.

## Focus scenario
- Fraud detection / portfolio risk analysis where labelled data are sparse and privacy constraints are strict.

## BLNN + Federated Neuromorphic Learning
- Local few/one-shot learning at each participant; share model parameters (not raw data) across nodes to build a stronger global model.

## Data & Privacy (pipeline)
- DOS to cut data needs (feature selection, augmentation/synthetic data, automatic labelling) and to maintain interoperability; anonymisation & HE-ready flows.

## Evaluation targets (examples)
- **+30%** fraud detection accuracy; **+40%** system performance; **~80%** reduction in data needs; **+50%** reduction in fraud cost; **+50%** increased trust.  
- Criteria include real-time integration, data utilisation, XAI clarity, federated-learning effectiveness, personalisation accuracy, trust, ethics compliance and TCO.
