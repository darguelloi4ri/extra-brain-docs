# Edge–Cloud Deployment & Co-Design

## Co-designed acceleration
- **RTL→FPGA/ASIC:** Parameterisable blocks, variable precision (fixed/float/bit-serial), on-chip training/re-training.  
- **Throughput–energy trade-offs:** Tunable kernels tailored to task and device class.

## Orchestration across ECC
- **Containers & WASM:** Kubernetes/KubeEdge and WASM/WASI for ultra-portable model services.  
- **Federated Neuromorphic Learning:** Privacy-preserving updates synchronised across nodes; data stay local.  
- **Observability:** Metrics for latency, energy, uncertainty and drift; hooks for safe rollbacks and A/B.
