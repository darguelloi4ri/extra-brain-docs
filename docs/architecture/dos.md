# Data Optimisation Spine (DOS)

**Purpose.** Deliver trustworthy, high-quality, low-bias data with minimal human overhead—supporting both real-time and batch learning.

## Capabilities
- **Ingestion & Interoperability:** Federated and heterogeneous sources via secure/open APIs; schema harmonisation.  
- **Feature Selection:** Emphasise salient signals; reduce dimensionality and training cost.  
- **Augmentation & Synthetic Data:** Increase coverage and balance classes while controlling drift.  
- **Automatic Labelling:** Lower curation cost with human verification loops.  
- **Privacy & Security:** Anonymisation, homomorphic-encryption–ready paths, and auditability.  
- **Visual Analytics:** Saliency, attribution and dataset diagnostics to surface risk, drift and bias.

!!! tip "Why DOS matters in real-time"
    BLNNs minimise pre-processing needs under tight latency; DOS still improves robustness, coverage and compliance for offline and online learning cycles.
