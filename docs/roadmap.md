# Roadmap & Implementation Approach

**Method.** Two integration cycles anchored in co-design/co-creation. Early requirements feed WP3/WP4 R&D; WP5 trust, explainability and human-centric methods run in parallel; pilots validate and refine.

## Co-creation touchpoints
1. **Foundations (T5.1):** Socio-technical analysis, risk/ethics, legal review.  
2. **Workshops:** Stakeholders surface values, concerns, needs; feed WP2 specs.  
3. **Living labs:** Users train/refine BLNNs; active-learning loops.  
4. **Iterative releases:** Pilot evaluations → requirements updates → improved releases.

**Open science & FAIR.** Early sharing, reproducibility, open access, and FAIR data stewardship guide outputs and datasets.
