# FAQ

**Q: How do BLNNs reduce data needs?**  
A: Local Hebbian/Bayesian learning plus sparse representations support faster, few/one-shot adaptation and robust online learning.

**Q: What makes the pipeline “trustworthy”?**  
A: Probabilistic reasoning for uncertainty, transparent saliency/attribution, active learning with human feedback, and alignment with IEEE/UNESCO/EU HLEG.

**Q: Why invest in FPGAs/ASICs?**  
A: Parameterisable precision and concurrency improve energy/latency massively for edge workloads while keeping adaptability.

**Q: How is privacy protected in federated setups?**  
A: Data remain local; updates/parameters are shared. DOS supports anonymisation; HE-ready paths enable secure compute when required.

**Q: Can I deploy on mixed hardware?**  
A: Yes—Kubernetes/KubeEdge for containers and WASM/WASI for lightweight targets enable portable services across the ECC.

**Q: Is XAI just saliency maps?**  
A: No—uncertainty estimates, counterfactuals/what-ifs, and task KPIs contextualise explanations for decision-makers.
