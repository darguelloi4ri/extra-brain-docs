# Trust, Explainability & Ethics

EXTRA-BRAIN bakes trust in at design time and run time.

## Design-time
- **Probabilistic foundations:** Bayesian/Hebbian updates quantify epistemic uncertainty to reason in novel settings.  
- **Interpretable signals:** Saliency and activation maps show what evidence the model used; uncertainty bands qualify decisions.  
- **Standards alignment:** IEEE/UNESCO/EU HLEG principles guide development and evaluation.

## Run-time
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Active learning loops select informative samples for user feedback and rapid adaptation.  
- **Transparent UIs:** Explanations accompany recommendations; “why” and “what-if” tooling exposes trade-offs.  
- **Policy compliance:** Data governance, privacy and fairness checks integrated with DOS and deployment.
