# Glossary

**BLNN** — Brain-Like Neural Network; uses biologically inspired structures and local learning.  
**BCPNN** — Bayesian Confidence Propagation NN; Hebbian/Bayesian plasticity rule set.  
**DOS** — Data Optimisation Spine; ingestion, harmonisation, feature selection, augmentation/synthesis, auto-labelling, privacy.  
**ECC** — Edge–Cloud Continuum; distributed deployment substrate from devices to cloud.  
**EUA** — Edge User Allocation; optimisation of UE→edge server assignments.  
**FNL** — Federated Neuromorphic Learning; privacy-preserving, distributed training across nodes.  
**HLS/RTL** — High-Level Synthesis / Register-Transfer Level; design entry points for FPGA/ASIC.  
**XAI** — Explainable AI; transparency of how/why decisions are produced, including uncertainty.
